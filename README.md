# AO Web Gateway

A front end to gather requests for Web Platforms Service.

To run locally till we get an app running in Openshift:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gsilver/web-ao-gateway
```
```bash
cd web-ao-gateway
```
and then run a server:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

For development use npm live-server:
```bash
npm install -g live-server
```
or
```bash
sudo npm install -g live-server
```

and then
```bash
live-server
```
